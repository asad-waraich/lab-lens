## Project Components
1. **Medical Report Summarization**: Simplifying discharge summaries using MIMIC-III clinical notes
2. **Chest X-ray Classification**: Pathology detection using MedMNIST-ChestMNIST (CPU-optimized)
3. **Department Routing**: (Future implementation)
4. **OTC Recommendations**: (Future implementation)

## Datasets
- **MIMIC-III v1.4**: Clinical notes and discharge summaries (requires PhysioNet credentialing)
- **MedMNIST-ChestMNIST**: Pre-processed 28×28 chest X-rays (immediate access)
